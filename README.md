# 42cursus - get_next_line

## About
The goal of this project is to create the function get_next_line.c which, when called in a loop, will then allow the available text in the file descriptor to be read one line at a time until the end of the file. The program must compile with the flag-D BUFFER_SIZE=xx which will be used as the buffer size for the read calls in get_next_line.
It is a challenging project which allows you to learn deeply about open(), read() and close() functions as well as static variables, file descriptors and the importance of handling the memory.
